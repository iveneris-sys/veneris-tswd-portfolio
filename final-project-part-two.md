# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.
Since the story I want to detail is universally applicable, I want to venture out of the university sphere to get feedback on what's working with my storyboard and visualizations, and what's falling short.

### Goal
Since I want to tell a story about energy generation and consumption moving away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy like wind and solar, I want my message to be clearly understood by the audience that otherwise does not have a background in climate change or energy systems. My visualizations should not be complex: they should be clear-cut depictions of the changes in the energy mix with little room for interpretation. My presentation on shortform should not be distracting with unnecesary images or gifs clouding the simple, effective data visualizations. My interviews with users aim to identify points of confusion, points of interest in the data visualizations, and opportunities for design improvement, especially around the narrative structure. Insights from the interviews will  inform the design direction for the third part of this project.

To make sure that my narrative is focused through the presentation, I want to have a wide sample of users to review my working project and let me know what messaging is not translated. 


### User Selection
Moving forward with user research, I want to cover a wide age-range from early 20s to mid-60s. Additionally, I want to speak with working profesisonals, graduate students, and non-degree holders, as well as individuals from different socio-economic groups. I decided on this range of users because the topic of the energy flip is so encompassing: the energy transition will impact everyone in the United States, and energy policy broadly has fiscal implications that really change the economic reality for everyone-- think the 1970s oil crisis and the mess that came from that! I want my messaging to land for a wider audience than just industry stakeholders who are involved in utilities or energy infrastructure. Also, since my call to action is based on advocacy and calling congressional representatives, I want my message to be digestable for people who are not usually interested in political action on a local level, but could be moved to advocate if the messaging is deemed critical. All of my participants are based in Pennsylvania, which is currently a hub for natural gas production and consumption, so I want to persuade them that a transition to cleaner energy is feasible. 

The following are my participants: 

- P001: 26, Working Professional
- P002: 24, Law Student
- P003: 25, Working Professional
- P004: 46, Working Professional
- P005: 63, Retired
- P006: 23, Unemployed

## Interview script

During these interviews, I want to identify points of confusion that may arise regarding the narrative flow. Specifically, I want to keep the focus on data visualizations without doing much "telling", but in my efforts to make the data speak for itself, it may interrupt the flow of the narrative that could use more context or primers for the data. I also tried to keep my shorthand within a specific dark, moody color palette to not distract from the visualizations, but I want more feedback on if the colors used in the background clash with the colors used in my visualizations.  


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Narrative Development     |Does the story flow smoothly between sections?                  |
|Narrative Development      |What context do you wish you saw in the current presentation?                  |
|Visualization Clarity      |When using the map functions, are you able to navigate the tools provided?                  |
|Visualization Clarity | In the Tableau visualizations, are the colors overwhelming? | 
|Narrative Development | Is the call to action sufficient? Should there be more primers to the action? |


### Script
Hello [Name]! Thank you for joining me [over zoom/in person] to review my project on energy consumption and generation in the United States. During this session, I will [give you the link to my site/present the site on my laptop] for 5 minutes. In that time, you may scroll and interact with the shorthand site. After those 5 minutes, I will ask you a series of 5 questions relating to your experience interacting with my shorthand site and exploring the visualizations included. I will record your responses and key takeaways, but your personal information like name, age, or other identifying features will not be recorded.

5 minutes start now. 

Thank you!
