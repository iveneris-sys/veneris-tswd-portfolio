# Critique By Design - Drug Harms in Great Britain, 2010
Hello!
For my data visualization redesign, I chose to explore a graph from the Economist


_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization
Link: https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/25/what-is-the-most-dangerous-drug 

I chose this visualization because I think the topic is still incredibly important: although this was published in 2010, I think that drug abuse and its effects not only on the user, but the community at large, should be highlighted. Additionally, I think it is striking that the data collection included alcohol in their study. All too often, I think that people neglect the fact that alcohol abuse is still damaging, and it is normalized throughout many countries and generations to abuse alcohol. Other motivations for choosing this data involve the reputable standing of the Economist, and my emerging interests in public health and tactics related to public information campaigns regarding diseases and afflictions. 


## Step two: the critique

Overall, the visualization does a good job at transmitting the idea that alcohol, heroin, and crack cocaine are among the most harmful drugs in the UK. The colors are not necessarily drawing "alertness" because of the cool-tones used, but the author does a good job at differentiating the harm to users and harm to others by choosing colors that are distinct enough from each other. I think they could have used other colors, though, to translate the "alertness". Additionally, I am not convinced that that stacked bars are a good way to communicate the message: does the "harm to others" section start where the "harm to self" bars end? Are they included in the part-of-a-whole? 

Also, I'm not sure that the title "paying through the nose" is informative, and I'm slightly surprised that the Economist published a graphic that seemingly includes a tongue-and-cheek joke at something that should be perceived as serious or important, if the Economist wishes to take a neutral standing on drug use, which is not inherently a bad thing. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution
I made two sketches, because I could not decide which one I liked more!

My initial sketch of the data: 

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1763082597921' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='In Britain: Alcohol, Heroin, and Crack Cocaine Deemed Most Harmful Among Users &amp; Community ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Dr&#47;DrugUse_FirstRedesignIVeneris&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='DrugUse_FirstRedesignIVeneris&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Dr&#47;DrugUse_FirstRedesignIVeneris&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763082597921');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>


## Step four: Test the solution

Questions that I asked: 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Which data visualization is the most understandable?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

| P001 | P002 | P003 |
|---|---|---|
| Prefer the second visualization | Prefer the second visualization| Prefer the second visualization |
| Should try to bold more aspects for readability | Should change the color scheme from blue and red to just red | Use dark red. Otherwise, gray is fine.|
| Fill the circle! | Title is very informative. Maybe you can edit the axes to be more concise, too | Explore opaqueness for the users/others to differentiate. |
| Try to shift the drug lables for readability. | Try to rotate the graph, as the drug labels are slightly difficult to read. | Maybe you could merge the users/others groups to have a more immediate comparison. |



Synthesis: 

After feedback, I knew that I was on the right track, but I needed to simplify a bit more! I'm in agreement with my groupmates that the second sketch is more enlightening, and I wanted to incorporate some of these design edits. Tableau is a little tricky for me to use, but I definitely want to make the colors a unified dark red/gray scheme, and I want to "pull apart" the data by using the comparisons. Also, I'm happy that they agree that the original title was less than helpful, and that the circles look more put together than the stacked bars. 

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
