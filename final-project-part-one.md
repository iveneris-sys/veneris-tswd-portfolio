# Outline
 
In my final project, I will explore energy in the United States. Specifically, I want to examine type of energy _generated_ and type of energy _consumed_, with an emphasis on regional impacts, from 2001-2024. Pointedly, I want to investigate how our energy mix is shifting away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Some people may be unconvinced that we are moving away from fossil fuels, but I think that a visualization showcasing the shifts over the course of 20 years will **inspire optimism and encourage the audience to think about how they can advocate for increased generation and utilization of cleaner energy sources.**  

Additionally, I feel that peoples' perception of clean energy in the United States has become clouded by partisanship: after working in the energy sector in a public affairs capacity, people tend to associate clean energy with more liberal regions, and fossil fuels with more conservative regions. When when we actually break down the energy mix into types of energy produced/consumed by region, we can see that there's a pretty heathy energy mix emerging across the United States, with the most interesting developments occuring in places like Texas that are commonly associated with fossil fuels: Texas actually produces a lot of renewable energy!

On a personal level, I'm interested in this topic because I have worked in public affairs in the energy sector, and I want to explore creating data-driven narratives and visualizations relating to the energy sector rather than platitudes!

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

For my project, I am planning on using data from the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA is an independent, non-partisan administration that collects data and applies statisical analyses for use by policymakers and the public alike. The datasets I will use are publicly available, and consist of two spreadsheets: the first of which details Net Energy Generation in the United States, broken down by year/state/type of energy, and the second of which details Consumption broken down by year/state/type of energy. Below are the links to my data. 


| Name | URL | Description |
|Existing Nameplate and Net Summer Capacity by Energy Source, Producer Type, and State|https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/|Details Type of Energy Consumption broken down by Year, State, and Energy Type. First Excel Link on website.|
|Net Generation in United States all Sectors Monthly |(https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/)|Details type of energy generated, amount of energy generated broken down by state, year. Second link on the website.|
